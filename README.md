    <i>Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which <br>
    the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to <br>
    storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game. <br>
    Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in 1982 by <br>
    Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan. <br> <br>
    The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or <br>
    a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as <br>
    storage locations. The player is confined to the board, and may move <br>
    horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). <br>
    The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. <br>
    Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. <br>
    The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations. <br> <br> </i>

The Goal of the project is to develop a copy of this game in terminal mode using ncurses library. <br>
map file representing the warehouse map, containing '#' for walls, 
‘P’ for the player, ‘X’ for boxes and ‘O’ for storage locations. <br>
To move the 'P' you must use the arrows 'KEY_UP', 'KEY_DOWN', 'KEY_LEFT'
and 'KEY_RIGHT'. To quit the game you must finish the map or press the 'esc' key. <br>
